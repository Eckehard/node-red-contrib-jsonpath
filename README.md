# JSONPath Node for NodeRed

This is a node for [NodeRed](http://nodered.org) a tool for easily wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services. 
This node allows to evaluate JSONPath expressions over the messages received. To this end this node relies on the [JSONPath](https://github.com/s3u/JSONPath) Node.js library.

For those familiar with XPath, JSONPath is to JSON what XPath is to XML. In a nutshell, JSONPath provides a syntax for specifying expressions that tell a JSONPath processor how to navigate through a given JSON structure in order to obtain the data required by the user. 
JSONPath therefore provides a convenient way for applications to obtain just the data required by specifying a simple expression, without having to resort to any further processing of the JSON data structure.
  
## How to Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

```
npm install node-red-contrib-jsonpath
```

## Using JSONPath

Since a JSON structure is usually anonymous and doesn't necessarily have a "root member object" JSONPath assumes the abstract name $ assigned to the outer level object.
To navigate through the JSON object, JSONPath expressions can use the dotâ€“notation as well as the bracket notation: 

```json
$.store.book[0].title
``` 

and 

```json
$['store']['book'][0]['title']
``` 

are thus equivalent expressions. 

Below you can find some basic guidelines and assistance on JSONPath. This documentation has been taken from http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/
 
```json
{
  "store": {
    "book": [
      {
        "category": "reference",
        "author": "Nigel Rees",
        "title": "Sayings of the Century",
        "price": 8.95
      },
      {
        "category": "fiction",
        "author": "Evelyn Waugh",
        "title": "Sword of Honour",
        "price": 12.99
      },
      {
        "category": "fiction",
        "author": "Herman Melville",
        "title": "Moby Dick",
        "isbn": "0-553-21311-3",
        "price": 8.99
      },
      {
        "category": "fiction",
        "author": "J. R. R. Tolkien",
        "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
        "isbn": "0-395-19395-8",
        "price": 22.99
      }
    ],
    "bicycle": {
      "color": "red",
      "price": 19.95
    }
  }
}
```


JSONPath               | Result
---------------------- | -------------------------------------
$.store.book[*].author | the authors of all books in the store 
$..author              | all authors 
$.store.*              | all things in store, which are some books and a red bicycle.
$.store..price         | the price of everything in the store.
$..book[2]             | the third book
$..book[(@.length-1)]  | the last book in order.
$..book[-1:]           |
$..book[0,1]           | the first two books
$..book[:2]            | 
$..book[?(@.isbn)]     | filter all books with isbn number
$..book[?(@.price<10)] | filter all books cheapier than 10
$..[?(@.price>19)]^    | categories with things more expensive than 19
$..*                   | all Elements in XML document. All members of JSON structure.
 

## Status

The node is at an early stage but is already usable. Currently the node provides support for evaluating JSONPath expressions over messages. Match results can all be sent in a bundle or each as a separate message.
